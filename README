--	ABOUT

	Bracky extends Brainfuck to a LISP-like state of functional beauty in that everything can, and 
must,be expressed in a crystal-clear and fundamentally beautiful stream of parentheses.

At this time the reccommended way to learn Bracky is through experimentation, as the author feels 
that documentation is both unnescessary bloat and a hindrance to expression, as perscription of 
method is against the free and unencumbered spirit of Bracky.

--	INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE

	1. "bracky" takes a Bracky source file as input (suggested naming convention is 
"sourcefile.()(").
	2. A Brainfuck interpreter in Ruby (1.9 and above is suggested) is supplied for your 
convenience, though any working implemetation should be fine.
	3. Express yourself
